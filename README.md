# parking-lot-system
 THE PARKING LOT EXIT SYSTEM came as an idea to me after I myself faced a small issue one day when I went for shopping at the mall. Practically every man does get tired or has some commitments in case of emergency , therefore this system can serve as the best in such times.  The idea of the project is that the sensor would detect the presence of the vehicle in front of the exit gate and depending on that notify the in-charge to do the needful.  There are many other things that I can add to it like, Signaling the exit of the vehicle directed by the in-charge remotely or maybe controlling the barricade however, I couldn't get the logistics required for it considering the latest World.
